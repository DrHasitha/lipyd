Python module `emese`
=====================

This module implements methods and workflows for MS/MS lipidomics data analysis.
Runs in both Python 2 and 3.
Current development aims to reorganize the methods into more classes in a modular
way in order to make it possible to apply the module more generally.
In the current workflows there are many elements specific for our screenings
which were first analysed using this module.
