lipyd â€“ A Python module for lipidomics LC MS/MS data analysis

The combinatorial and hierarchic diversity of lipid classes makes lipidomics
data processing challenging. Software tools have been developed recently to
address this challenge. However a library which could serve as a basis for
development of data processing and analysis workflows is still missing.

Here we present lipyd, a Python module for lipidomics data analysis. lipyd
consists of a number of submodules for various tasks. It comes with ~170 lipid
varieties predefined, and users can add more, in order to build custom mass
databases, in addition it incorporates SwissLipids and LipidMaps data. lipyd
is able to search various adduct ion masses against all these data sets. The
MS2 module comes with ~90 types of aliphatic chain derived and ~150 headgroup
derived fragments predefined. lipyd annotates MS2 scans and applies rule based
ethods to identify lipids. The MS2 spectrum identification is based on our own
standards and literature. It covers more than 150 lipid varieties, most of
them both in positive and negative ion modes. Beside the LC MS/MS analysis
lipyd offers higher level methods to analyse features across multiple samples.

Python today is one of the most popular programming languages in
bioinformatics and this ensures colleagues will find convenient to use lipyd
and integrate it in their workflows. lipyd is a free, open source software
available at github.com/saezlab/lipyd.
